LIght Rdf Browser (LiRB) is a lightweight interface for interactive browsing over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) RDF. LiRB features a text-based Web interface, providing a navigation experience similar to traditional Web pages, promoting a lower learning curve for users.

LiRB uses simple and fast queries, being ideal for the browsing of massive or virtual KGs. In addition, the tool also allows the abstraction of N-ary relationships to represent the semantics of  relationshipâ€™s properties. More over, LiRB have support to presents the results of saved queries to the user. Finally, LiRB also supports the feature of displaying events Timelines of resource in the KG.

## To Configurate the browser 
1. Configure the endpoints to be queried and visualization parameters in the file ["config.py"](https://github.com/CaioViktor/LiRB/blob/main/config.py) following the instructions.
2. Define the saved queries in the file ["saved_queries.py"](https://github.com/CaioViktor/LiRB/blob/main/saved_queries.py)
3. Set the host address in the file ["server.sh"](https://github.com/CaioViktor/LiRB/blob/main/server.sh)
* Obs.: The configuration files already contain example configurations for the demo KG.
## To run the browser
1. Make sure that the endpoints specified in the configurations are accessible.
2. in the application's root directory in the therminal, run the command:
   > ./server.sh
3. Access the address provided in the configuration file ["server.sh"](https://github.com/CaioViktor/LiRB/blob/main/server.sh)

2. Browsing resource on LiRB:
   1. Abstracting N-ary relation
